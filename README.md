**Getting Started: Running the Application**

You have two options for running the application:

**1. Using the Python Source Code:**

   *   **Install Dependencies:** Before running the application, ensure you have all the required Python packages installed. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory. Then, execute the following command:

       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

       This command will install the necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
   *   **Run the Application:** Once the dependencies are installed, you can launch the application using:

       ```bash
       python main.py
       ```

**2. Using the Pre-built Executable:**

   *   **Locate the Executable:** The application is also available as a pre-built executable, located in the `dist` folder. The full path to the executable is: `dist\Simulations HUB\Simulations HUB.exe`
   *   **Run the Executable:** Simply double-click the `Simulations HUB.exe` file to launch the application. No separate Python installation or dependency management is required for this method. You can also run it by using this command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        .\dist\Simulations HUB\Simulations HUB.exe
        ```

# Building a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Data Visualization Using Tkinter and CustomTkinter

Data visualization plays a critical role in data analysis, helping users uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that may not be immediately apparent in raw or text-based data. A well-designed GUI can make this process more intuitive and user-friendly, offering a seamless experience for both novice and experienced users.

### Why Use Tkinter and CustomTkinter?

Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python, offering a simple yet powerful framework for creating GUI applications. CustomTkinter, an enhanced extension of Tkinter, provides additional widgets, customization options, and styling features, allowing you to build visually appealing and modern interfaces with minimal effort.

### Key Features of the Data Visualization GUI

This GUI will incorporate several essential features:

- **Graph Plotting**: Users can plot graphs based on predefined parameters or enter custom parameters, giving them flexibility in how they visualize their data.
  
- **Customizable Parameters**: The GUI will support both default and user-defined parameters for graph plotting, allowing for a highly customizable experience.

- **Easy Function Integration**: Users can add new functions to plot with ease, streamlining the process of expanding the toolâ€™s functionality.

- **Appearance Modes**: The interface will include multiple appearance modes, such as light and dark themes, giving users the option to customize the GUI to their preferences or reduce eye strain.

- **Flexible Scaling Options**: The GUI will offer a variety of scale options for the graphs, enabling users to adjust the resolution and format of the data visualization as needed.

- **Export Functionality**: A dedicated export window will allow users to save the graph and calculated coordinates, making it easy to integrate visualizations into reports or presentations.

### Running the Application

To run this application you just need to run it like this:
```bash
python main.py
```
